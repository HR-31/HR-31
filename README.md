### My name is Harish and I am obsessed with Blockchain.

I'm currently diving deep into the realms of blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. After crafting a decentralized betting app on Ethereum, I'm open to working on various projects to innovate and optimize smart contracts. My passion for learning never ceases; recently, I've embarked on a transformative journey through MIT's Blockchain and Money course, and Harvard's renowned CS50 course, sharpening my skills in C, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Exploring solidity, web3.js and gas-optimised efficient programming has ignited a newfound enthusiasm for development, steering my path towards exciting technological frontiers.

I'm open to collaborating on groundbreaking projects in blockchain, AI, machine learning, and quantum computing. If you're equally passionate about building solutions that leverage cutting-edge tech, I'd like to explore how we can work together. Whether it's co-founding a firm to solve a specific problem or tackling challenges in existing platforms, my goal is to contribute to real-world solutions. Feel free to ask me about my hands-on experiences in blockchain technology or my ambitious final project on decentralized applications.

Fun fact about me: My journey began in 2012 with a single article about Bitcoin in the Financial Times while I was at university. This spark led me down a path where I built and maintained Ethereum mining rigs worth over Â£100,000 and found joy in solving intricate tech puzzles.
