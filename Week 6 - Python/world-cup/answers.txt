Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

It was interesting to see a a couple of predictions go down to 0% probability of winning.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would call it quits after 1000 simulations. Beyond that, the time taken triples but the predictions do not change much.
